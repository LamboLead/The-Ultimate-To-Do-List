* To-do list

-> Investigate about functional programming examples to handle user input and select HTML elements.
- Result: For now, use the procedural/functional way of doing things: Define html elements and add event listeners to them.

- Done!
-> Handle user input properly (task insert, update list name & update task caption)
-> Clear input element with button
-> Enter task with button
-> Delete tasks
-> Edit tasks
-> Check tasks
-> Reorder tasks
-> Create new list
-> Switch to certain list
-> Delete list (add confirmation window)
-> Update list name
-> Reorder lists

- In progress
-> Add error handling for input (Add a fadeout for the rest of the page but the input element, and clear it if the input is OK).
  - Testing...

* Customization

- Done!
-> Set user images as background
-> Toggle animations properly
-> Toggle theme
-> Save images & retrieve them from database
-> Set up slider functionality

- In progress
-> Set user metadata everytime the background image changes

* Styling

- Done!
-> Fix responsiveness
-> Fix colors for confirmation box
-> Fix vertical animations

- In progress
-> Fix organizing background settings
-> Set up pop-up

* Issues

-> To-do > On delete list: The list is not being deleted inside "Lists" array on IndexedDB, causing problems.
  <Status: Testing>

-> To-do > On creating new lists: The list is not being saved inside "Lists" array on IndexedDB.
  <Status: Testing>
  - Possible causes:
    > MutationObserver is not being triggered when the user creates new lists due to the timeout that triggers the storing of information.
  - Solution:
    > Right after the 'Create new list' button is clicked, disable it until the database has saved changes (or after a timeout has finished).

-> To-do > On retrieving Api-images: When rendering slider, data in the store "Lists" is being saved without intention.
  <Status: Fixed!>
  - Possible causes:
    > MutationObserver malfunction
  - Solution:
    > Filter out the attributes that the observer is looking at.

-> Background manager > Setting up animations for the first time: Database value for 'animations' does not match with what appears on screen.
  <Status: Testing>
  - Possible causes:
    > The program doesn't set a default value for animations in the database.

-> To-do > On checking tasks: Information saving is not triggered.
  <Status: Testing>
  - Possible causes:
    > MutationObserver isn't picking changes from the DOM.
  - Solution:
    > Change the 'checked' attribute of the checkbox element instead of the 'checked' property.

-> Slider > On showing slider div when the background div is not shown: The fetched images do not accomodate to the slider's width.
  <Status: Testing>
  - Possible causes:
    > The frameWidth for the slider has the wrong value because the slider div is hidden.
  - Solution:
    > Keep the slider div opened (but hidden) until the slider has loaded.

-> Performance: The program is too slow!
  - Possible causes:
    > Hardware limitations (processor, CPU, hard drive)
    > Too much animations
    > Bad code: Memory leak, unintended calling of functions, bad coding practices...
  - Solutions:
    > Rescoped MutationObserver, which called functions to process data inside IndexedDB.

-> Fetched images > On switching background images or slider images: Images take too long to load.
  - Possible causes:
    > Bad network status
  - Solutions:
    > Convert the already-fetched background images into base64 urls to stop depending on the network for image loading.
