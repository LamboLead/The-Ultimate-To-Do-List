* To-do list

-> Investigate about functional programming examples to handle user input and select HTML elements.
- Result: For now, use the procedural/functional way of doing things: Define html elements and add event listeners to them.

-> Handle user input properly (task insert, update list name & update task caption)

-> Clear input element with button
-> Enter task with button

-> Delete tasks
-> Edit tasks
-> Check tasks
-> Reorder tasks
- Result: All right!

-> Create new list
- Done!
-> Switch to certain list
- Done!
-> Delete list (add confirmation window)
- Done!

- IMPORTANT MESSAGE: Fix the code organization regarding the showStartPage&Co. functions.

-> Add error handling for input (Add a fadeout for the rest of the page but the input element, and clear it if the input is OK).

* Customization

-> Toggle animations properly
