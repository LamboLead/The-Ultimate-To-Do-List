## Introduction
This idea came from various youtubers ([Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q), [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw), [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)) whose channels are based on web and software development. This is a training project, and its purpose while building was to practice my skills and knowledge regarding frontend web development.

This to-do list has a considerable set of features that will be listed [here](#functionalities).
